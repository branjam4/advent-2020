# Introduction to advent-2020

## Day 1

At the suggestion of some clojurists, I used combinatorics to solve the problem. 
If I worked on it more, I'd want the second part to run faster.

## Day 2

Wanted to get some experience with Instaparse, but I'm aware regular expressions 
alone would be sufficient for solving the problems.

## Day 3

I end up using indexed maps to solve both parts, but wonder if there's a cleaner 
or more idiomatic way to hack the solution together.
